# SeptemberChallenge
September Challenges of LeetCode with C# .Net Core.

Tried to get 100% with C# in solutions.

Most of the solutions more than one approach to solve. At first, I try to solve in more intuitive way, without much thinking about perfect data structure or algorithm.
And after that, tried to solve with more appropriate algorithmic and effecient way.

I also added xUnit to write some test cases if needed before submitting solutioin. 

There is project call Library which contains library funciton like Tree contruction from level order traversal array.
